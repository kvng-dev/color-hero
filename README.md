# Color Heroes Game üéÆ

Welcome to **Color Heroes**, a fun and interactive color-matching game built using React! Your goal is to guess the target color from a set of options. Each correct guess earns points, but each incorrect guess costs you a heart. Lose all hearts, and the game is over! üéâ

## Features

- üé® **Color Matching**: Match the target color from a set of 6 color options.
- üíñ **Hearts System**: You have 3 hearts, which decrease with incorrect guesses.
- üèÜ **Score Tracking**: Your score is displayed, and you aim to get the highest score possible.
- üéâ **Celebration Effects**: Enjoy fun animations, such as confetti and celebrations, when you win or make a correct guess!
- üòû **Game Over**: If you lose all your hearts, the game ends and displays your final score.
